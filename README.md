# sm6A-DM project

we introduce "m6A Disruption Mutations (m6A-DMs)" as a novel category of mutations within cancer genomes that perturb m6A modification patterns, thus affecting mRNA fate. We adopted a three-step screening strategy to identify and characterize potential mDMs in cancer. The analysis includes three R packages and an Excel file containing processed data.
